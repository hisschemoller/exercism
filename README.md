# Exercism

https://exercism.io/

I'm doing the Exercism C track exercises to learn and get experience programming C.

For a better overview I'm also reading Nick Parlante's C programming PDFs:

- Essential C, http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/101/
- Pointers and Memory, http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/102/
- Linked List Basics, http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/103/
- Linked List Problems, http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/105/
